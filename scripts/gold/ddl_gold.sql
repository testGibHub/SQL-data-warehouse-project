/*
  DDL Script: Create Gold Views
===============================================================================
 Script purpose:
  This script creates views for the Gold layer in the data warehouse.
  The Gold layer represents the final dimension and fact tables(Star Schema)

  Each layer performs transformations and combines data from the silver layer
  to produce a clean, enriched and bussiness ready dataset.

  Usage:
    - These views can be queried directly for analytics and reporting.
